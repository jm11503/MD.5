# Hello From Jared and Daniel!

Our project is a (bad) recreation of the MD5 hashing algorithm.

Instead we created MD.5

For your exercises (also located in HOMEWROK.md), you will need to test our code for us (we were too lazy to do it ourselves).

1. Find the hash of 'grape'
2. Find the hash of 'jelly'
3. Find the hash of 'grape jelly'
4. Find the hash HASHME.txt (located in the repo)
5. What is one weakness of our algorithm?
6. If you had to guess, how does the MD5 algorithm work?
7. Do you have any clue what we did wrong? (no seriously, we have no clue)
8. *Challenge:* Crack our algorthim by forcing collisions. This is hard, it could take awhile
